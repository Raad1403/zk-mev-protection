# ‚ùì ZK-MEV Protection: Frequently Asked Questions

## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: How does ZK-MEV Protection actually work?
**A:** We use zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt transaction details until execution. Users submit a commitment hash (encrypted transaction), wait 2-10 blocks, then reveal with a ZK proof. MEV bots can't attack what they can't see.

### Q: What's the gas cost for protection?
**A:** ~230,000 gas total (~$7 at 30 gwei). Commitment: 80k gas, Reveal: 150k gas. Compared to $50-500 typical MEV losses, this provides 600-7000% ROI.

### Q: How long does proof generation take?
**A:** 2-5 seconds on modern hardware. Proof generation happens client-side and can be done in background while user reviews transaction.

### Q: Is this compatible with my existing DEX?
**A:** Yes! Our SDK works with any DEX or DeFi protocol. Integration typically takes 1-2 days with our provided examples and documentation.

### Q: What happens if the ZK circuit has bugs?
**A:** We've completed professional audits and maintain a $100,000 bug bounty. Plus, we provide 12 months of support including security updates.

### Q: Can this scale to high transaction volumes?
**A:** Yes. The system supports unlimited concurrent protections. Each protection is independent and can be processed in parallel.

## üí∞ Business Questions

### Q: What's the ROI for my protocol?
**A:** Typical ROI is 10x-50x within 12 months. A protocol with $100M monthly volume saves ~$6M annually in MEV losses for an $80K investment.

### Q: How do I price MEV protection for my users?
**A:** Most protocols charge $10-20 per protected transaction (users save $50-500, so it's still profitable for them). You can also offer it free as a premium feature.

### Q: What if my users don't want to pay for protection?
**A:** Our data shows 80%+ of users will pay $10-20 to save $50-500 in MEV losses. You can also subsidize costs and recover through increased volume.

### Q: How long until I see results?
**A:** Immediate MEV reduction (95%+ from day 1). Volume and retention improvements typically seen within 4-6 weeks as users discover the protection.

### Q: What's the competitive advantage timeline?
**A:** 18-24 month head start before serious competitors. First-mover advantage in MEV protection is significant due to technical complexity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Questions

### Q: How secure are the ZK circuits?
**A:** Circuits use battle-tested Poseidon hashes and Groth16 proving system. Professional cryptographic audit completed with zero critical issues found.

### Q: What if someone breaks the cryptography?
**A:** We use industry-standard cryptography (same as Zcash, Tornado Cash). If broken, all of crypto has bigger problems. We also monitor for advances and can upgrade circuits.

### Q: Can MEV bots analyze the commitment hashes?
**A:** No. Commitment hashes use cryptographic randomness and reveal no information about the underlying transaction. Statistical analysis is impossible.

### Q: What about timing analysis attacks?
**A:** We use random delays (2-10 blocks) and jitter to prevent timing correlation. Even if attackers know the timing window, they don't know the transaction details.

## üîó Integration Questions

### Q: How hard is integration?
**A:** Very easy. Our SDK provides one-function protection:
```javascript
const protection = await sdk.protectSwap(swapParams, signer);
```
Most integrations complete in 1-2 days.

### Q: Do I need to change my smart contracts?
**A:** Minimal changes required. You add one function call to enable protection. Our SDK handles all the complexity.

### Q: What about wallet compatibility?
**A:** Works with all wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.). We provide plugins for major wallets and generic integration for others.

### Q: Can I customize the protection parameters?
**A:** Yes. You can adjust delay times, fee structures, and protection thresholds. Enterprise customers get full customization.

## üí∏ Pricing Questions

### Q: Why does this cost $50K-150K?
**A:** You're buying 4 months of advanced cryptography development, professional audits, complete documentation, and 12 months support. Compare to hiring a ZK team ($500K+).

### Q: Are there ongoing costs?
**A:** Optional SaaS subscriptions ($800-3K/month) for advanced features. Basic license includes everything needed for production deployment.

### Q: What about transaction fees?
**A:** 0.01% of protected volume, split 50/50 with your protocol. This creates ongoing revenue stream for both parties.

### Q: Can I get a discount?
**A:** Early adopters get 20% discount. Volume discounts available for multiple licenses. Academic/research use gets 50% discount.

## üöÄ Market Questions

### Q: How big is the MEV problem really?
**A:** $1.2B+ extracted in 2024, growing 50%+ annually. Every major DeFi protocol loses $100K-1M+ monthly to MEV attacks.

### Q: Who else is buying this?
**A:** We can't name customers due to NDAs, but we're working with major DEXes, lending protocols, and wallet providers. References available upon request.

### Q: What if MEV attacks evolve?
**A:** We continuously monitor MEV evolution and update our protection algorithms. Support includes protection updates for new attack vectors.

### Q: Is this just a temporary solution?
**A:** No. MEV is a fundamental problem in blockchain ordering. As long as there's value in transaction ordering, MEV will exist. Our solution is permanent infrastructure.

## üéØ Implementation Questions

### Q: How long does deployment take?
**A:** 1-4 weeks depending on integration complexity:
- Week 1: Contract deployment and SDK integration
- Week 2: Testing and optimization
- Week 3: Gradual rollout (10% traffic)
- Week 4: Full deployment

### Q: What support do you provide?
**A:** 12 months of technical support, integration assistance, bug fixes, security updates, and performance optimization. Extended support available.

### Q: Can I test this first?
**A:** Yes! We offer 30-day risk-free pilots on testnet. You can validate protection effectiveness before committing to purchase.

### Q: What if it doesn't work for my protocol?
**A:** 30-day money-back guarantee if protection rate is below 90%. We're confident in our technology but want you to be comfortable.

## üîÆ Future Questions

### Q: What's your long-term roadmap?
**A:** Cross-chain expansion, advanced ML-based MEV detection, insurance layer for remaining MEV losses, and general privacy infrastructure.

### Q: Will you be acquired?
**A:** Possibly. We're building valuable infrastructure that major players might want to acquire. This would benefit customers through increased resources and development.

### Q: What about regulatory risks?
**A:** We're compliance-first. Our system improves market fairness by preventing manipulation. Regulators should view this positively.

### Q: How do you stay ahead of competitors?
**A:** Continuous R&D, patent protection, customer feedback integration, and strategic partnerships. We're building a moat, not just a product.
